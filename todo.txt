tw2.core
    compound ids
        unit tests
            force ids to begin with a letter

    registrations for repeating widgets
        get_link
        only register in the zero-th repetition
        make sure they are registered at startup

    children_deep
        dupe id
        validation
        grandchild hiding
    refactor resources even more - avoid need to do parent=self.__class__ when adding dynamically
        inject() - in TW2, we use it to inject javascript only widgets in the wsgi stream.
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"
    problem with colons as id separator - doesn't work in css, it thinks they're pseudo classes
        configurable compound id separator - relies on global config
    resources - caching
        I can generate expires/max-age, but it doesn't make it cache
        make the static file server support http 1.1 stuff like if-modified-since
            http://pythonpaste.org/modules/fileapp.html
    the "extra children" thing for datasrc (and submit) - avoid reserved_names
    better dev server - paste, auto reload, weberror

auto-registering controllers
    rewrite class name like elixir does

validation
    MatchField - relies on state
    selection validators
        Better required messages - "Select a value"
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
    FormEncode validators and required CSS
    global config for encoding

documentation
    core
        explain global_config/middleware, etc
        explain the order things happen - building attrs, registering resources, etc.
    forms
        getting started
            with wsgi
            standalone
        tutorials
            appearance
                better genshi abs path thingy
            validation
            elixir
    shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py
        is there a standard approach for this?

widget browser
    make tw.core neat
    support rst
        tsrweb has one approach; maybe sphinx has a better way?
    validators __repr__ better
    tw branding
    validators - messages

support python 2.4 and 2.6
    use paste web server?

tw2.dynforms
    OtherSingleSelectField
    unique column in growinggrid
    make onload trigger onchange

yui
    use get_link
    data table
