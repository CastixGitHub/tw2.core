tw.forms & validation
    how does msf work?
    some fields need particular work (checkbox, fileupload)
    when redisplaying on error:
        run validator.to_python(x, validate=False)
        this is for selection fields
            if to_python fails - use None
            if it doesn't match an item - just no item is selected
        everything else (in tw.forms at least) just display as-is
