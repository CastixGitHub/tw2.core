ooops, shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py

tw2.core
    rename fetch_data to view_request (also: post_define to define?)
    children_deep / _sub_compound
        grandchild hiding
    resources -expires header
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"
    the way ids work with displayonlywidget isn't quite right

auto-registering controllers
    add link to widget once registered
    avoid multiple registrations for repeating widgets
    rewrite class name like elixir does
    not in ('Page', 'FormPage') is a hack

validation
    validator browser
    have display detect validated_widget in rl
    MatchField
    selection validators
        Better required messages - "Select a value"
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
        distinguish None and 0
    FormEncode validators and required CSS
