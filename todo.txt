widget instance per request
    display as a class or instance method
    params_as_vars config option
    avoid so many subclasses being created - inplace addition of parent


fix GridLayout sample

unit tests
    validators - doc tests?
    children_deep / _sub_compound

validation
    post_define - fe validator
    test compound id with deeply nested widgets
    whole form validators
        twc.MatchValidator
    non-safe widgets - most resources are non-safe
    how does msf work?
    have display detect validated_widget in rl

    when redisplaying on error:
        run validator.to_python(x, validate=False)
        this is for selection fields
            if to_python fails - use None
            if it doesn't match an item - just no item is selected
        everything else (in tw.forms at least) just display as-is

documentation
    configuration
    widget lifecycle
    params - tidy up
        remove args from autoclass
    move template info to parameter doc
    resources
    middleware (deserves its own section?)

misc
    setup.py - entrypoints
        not sure: [paste.filter_app_factory] - what is this?
    i18n
        we've got the global now, where to call it?
    WidgetTestCase
    review all the TBDs
    use quotes in all exceptions

widget browser
    make tw.core neat
    support rst
    paster command entry point -- update tutorial
        tweak help

frameworks
    pylons / tg2
    cp3
    django
    @validate decorator


tw2.forms
    DemoImageButton
    form id - ${child.id}:_form
    BaseLayout - display hidden fields separately
    data grid
    validation
        some fields need particular work (checkbox, fileupload)
    named buttons
    bug: radiobuttonlist and table were clashing if same id
        the repeating should keep them separate
