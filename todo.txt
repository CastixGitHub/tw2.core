Questions
    What does the "paste.filter_app_factory" entry point do?
    sphinx: how to do :autoclass: that doesn't show __init__ args

tidy up id, id_elem, _compound_id
    avoid generating id=""

tw2.forms
    fix grid layout sample ***
    BaseLayout - display hidden fields separately

validation
    post_define - fe validator
    non-safe widgets - most resources are non-safe
    have display detect validated_widget in rl

tw.forms & validation
    test all field types for roundtripping
        file upload
        select with codes
        checkbox
        better required messages for select fields

    when redisplaying on error:
        run validator.to_python(x, validate=False)
        this is for selection fields
            if to_python fails - use None
            if it doesn't match an item - just no item is selected
        everything else (in tw.forms at least) just display as-is
