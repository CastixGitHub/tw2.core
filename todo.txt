    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"
    the way ids work with displayonlywidget isn't quite right

auto-registering controllers
    add link to widget once registered
    avoid multiple registrations for repeating widgets
    rewrite class name like elixir does

validation
    have display detect validated_widget in rl
    MatchField
    selection validators
        Better required messages - "Select a value"
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
    FormEncode validators and required CSS

    tw branding
    shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py
        is there a standard approach for this?

widget browser
    make tw.core neat
    support rst
        tsrweb has one approach; maybe sphinx has a better way?
    validators __repr__ better
    tw branding
    validators - messages

support python 2.4 and 2.6
    use paste web server?
