sqlalchemy
    get a simple form working
    lists
    fkeyselect
    Relations
        skip cols for MTO relations
        MTO
            view - label
            edit - select / ajax

    how to update
        updating A with B
        if B is AutoField
            update A with params B has specified
        else
            update B with params A has specified and B not *** this sounds like trouble!
            ok, for now just use B, any param set to auto is taken from A
