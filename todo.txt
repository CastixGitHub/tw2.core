Hi,

I've done a little more work on tw2, and it's now in a state where it's worth having a go.



widget browser branding
try out tutorials

Smaller jobs:
    Make SelectionList and SelectionTable support option grouping
    CSRF protection
    tw2.dynforms Cascading support

Bigger jobs:
    Framework integration
    tw2.dojo / jquery / yui
    multiple template support


http://bitbucket.org/paj/tw2dynforms/

tw2.forms
    gridlayout validation - use an image with hover
        and the image is a resource...

    refactor LabelHiddenField? - it's just a LabelField with an option set
        maybe LabelField shouldn't have the hidden field, just be used for data grids
    selectionfield - auto item_validator
    shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
    remove submit_text, submit_attrs
    remove textbox.size maxlength?
    FormEncode validators and required CSS

tw2.core
    children_deep / _sub_compound
        grandchild hiding
    csrf protection
    resources -expires header
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"

general infrastructure needed
    validator messages
        better required messages for select fields, upload fields, etc.
        initially - change to twc.Required behaviour *** this is broken anyway
        message for whole form

    lets go for global middleware
        discuss in design doc ***

    autoinitialising controllers
        this is important

validation
    have display detect validated_widget in rl
    client-side
    MatchField

documentation
    dynforms - build on forms with sa, standalone

widget browser
    make tw.core neat
    support rst
    validators __repr__ better

support python 2.4 and 2.6
    use paste web server?

widget browser
    avoid the dodgy '.samples' entrypoint
    lightweight tab-switcher - no ajax to start with
        Summary / Demo Source / Parameters / Source / Template
    tw branding

dynforms
    growing repeater
    calling a js func to initialise a widget
        need to hook this for growing
    tutorial
        extra rows
        labelhiddenbroken
        webob redirect

sqlalchemy
    db migration
        | [4] http://code.google.com/p/sqlalchemy-migrate/
        | [5] http://trac.ollix.org/miruku/
    elixir sessions

    get a simple form working
    lists
    fkeyselect
    Relations
        skip cols for MTO relations
        MTO
            view - label
            edit - select / ajax

    how to update
        updating A with B
        if B is AutoField
            update A with params B has specified
        else
            update B with params A has specified and B not *** this sounds like trouble!
            ok, for now just use B, any param set to auto is taken from A

move attrs generation to display? would make some other bits easier
ooops, shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py
