ooops, shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py

tw2.forms
    selection validators
        "Select a value"
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
        distinguish None and 0
    password field leaks data
    FormEncode validators and required CSS

tw2.core
    children_deep / _sub_compound
        grandchild hiding
    resources -expires header
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"
    the way ids work with displayonlywidget isn't quite right
    move attr generation to display? would make some other bits easier

auto-registering controllers
    if a widget has a request method, and an id, register it
        this results in lots of registrations for repeating widgets

validation
    messages
        validators can rewrite message names, e.g. required -> select_required
            if msg is a tuple, it's (newname, msg)

        widget.validator_msgs
            message for whole form
            multiple select
        command to extract all validation messages
    change twc.Required behaviour
    have display detect validated_widget in rl
    MatchField
