tw2.core
    children_deep
        dupe id
        validation
        grandchild hiding
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"
    the way ids work with displayonlywidget isn't quite right
        make compound_id always use the last element?
    problem with colons as id separator - doesn't work in css, it thinks they're pseudo classes
    resources - caching
        I can generate expires/max-age, but it doesn't make it cache
    check resource dir trav with backslash *****
    the "extra children" thing for datasrc (and submit) - avoid reserved_names

auto-registering controllers
    add link to widget once registered ****
    avoid multiple registrations for repeating widgets
        only register in the zero-th repetition
    rewrite class name like elixir does

validation
    MatchField - relies on state
    selection validators
        Better required messages - "Select a value"
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
    FormEncode validators and required CSS

documentation
    core
        explain mutables and safe_modify
        explain global_config/middleware, etc.
    forms
        getting started
            with wsgi
            standalone
        tutorials
            appearance
                better genshi abs path thingy
            validation
            elixir
                webob redirect
    dynforms
        dyndemo
    tw branding
    shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py
        is there a standard approach for this?

widget browser
    make tw.core neat
    support rst
        tsrweb has one approach; maybe sphinx has a better way?
    validators __repr__ better
    tw branding
    validators - messages

support python 2.4 and 2.6
    use paste web server?

tw2.dynforms
    OtherSingleSelectField
    unique column in growinggrid
    make onload trigger onchange
    growingtextarea
    text field with suggestion


yui
    core changes
        keep order of resources

    data controls:
        data source
        autocomplete
             margin-bottom:2em;
        data table

    widget browser - need skin

    later
        move script out of templates - just use PlainWidget for most of them
            this depends a lot on the growing work
        rename options? it clashes with SelectionField.options
        autocomplete: experiment with force_select
        container - dialogs, tooltips
        Menu
        Paginator
        ImageCropper
        carousel - picking images
        Resize
        YUI CSS base

    // Use a LocalDataSource
    var oDS = new YAHOO.util.LocalDataSource(YAHOO.example.Data.arrayStates);
    // Optional to define fields for single-dimensional array
    oDS.responseSchema = {fields : ["state"]};
