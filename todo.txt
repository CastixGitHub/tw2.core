tw2.core
    check resource dir trav with backslash
    the way ids work with displayonlywidget isn't quite right
        make compound_id always use the last element?
    force ids to begin with a letter

    children_deep
        dupe id
        validation
        grandchild hiding
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"
    problem with colons as id separator - doesn't work in css, it thinks they're pseudo classes
        configurable compound id separator
    resources - caching
        I can generate expires/max-age, but it doesn't make it cache
        make the static file server support http 1.1 stuff like if-modified-since
    the "extra children" thing for datasrc (and submit) - avoid reserved_names
    better dev server - paste, auto reload, weberror
    move tw2.tests from devtools to core (maybe core.test_templates?)


auto-registering controllers
    add link to widget once registered
    avoid multiple registrations for repeating widgets
        only register in the zero-th repetition
        make sure they are registered at startup
    rewrite class name like elixir does

validation
    MatchField - relies on state
    selection validators
        Better required messages - "Select a value"
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
    FormEncode validators and required CSS
    global config for encoding

documentation
    core
        explain global_config/middleware, etc.
    forms
        getting started
            with wsgi
            standalone
        tutorials
            appearance
                better genshi abs path thingy
            validation
            elixir
    shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py
        is there a standard approach for this?

widget browser
    make tw.core neat
    support rst
        tsrweb has one approach; maybe sphinx has a better way?
    validators __repr__ better
    tw branding
    validators - messages

support python 2.4 and 2.6
    use paste web server?

tw2.dynforms
    OtherSingleSelectField
    unique column in growinggrid
    make onload trigger onchange


yui
    data controls:
        data source
        autocomplete
             margin-bottom:2em;
        data table

    widget browser - need skin

    // Use a LocalDataSource
    var oDS = new YAHOO.util.LocalDataSource(YAHOO.example.Data.arrayStates);
    // Optional to define fields for single-dimensional array
    oDS.responseSchema = {fields : ["state"]};

        twc.JSLink(modname=__name__, filename="static/data.js"),
