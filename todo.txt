tw2.forms
    refactor LabelHiddenField? - it's just a LabelField with an option set
        maybe LabelField shouldn't have the hidden field, just be used for data grids
    item_validator
        auto - or a redesign to always store strings could remove the need
        shouldn't have item_validator on SingleSelectField???
    refactor submit_text, submit_attrs
    remove textbox maxlength
    FormEncode validators and required CSS

tw2.core
    children_deep / _sub_compound
        grandchild hiding
    resources -expires header
    quickstart - autodetect package from "tw2.package"

validator messages
    better required messages for select fields, upload fields, etc.
    change twc.Required behaviour
    message for whole form
    per-middleware dict mapping message names to messages
    also per-validator override of messages
    and widgets/validators can rewrite message names, e.g. required -> select_required
    *** but how does tw.forms add validation messages?
        maybe build up that global dict at runtime

auto-registering controllers
    if a widget has a request method, and an id, register it
        this results in lots of registrations for repeating widgets

resources
    unit tests

validation
    have display detect validated_widget in rl
    MatchField

move attrs generation to display? would make some other bits easier
ooops, shouldn't have removed release.py - it shares details between doc and setup.py
