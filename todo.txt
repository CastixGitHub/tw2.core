tw2.forms
    FormEncode validators and required CSS
    BaseLayout - display hidden fields separately
    gridlayout & hidden fields
    gridlayout validation - use an image with hover
    auto '' on SingleSelectField
    name2label - remove _id

general infrastructure needed
    calling a js func to initialise a widget ** need to hook this for growing
    validator messages
        better required messages for select fields, upload fields, etc.
        initially - change to twc.Required behaviour *** this is broken anyway
        message for whole form
    autoinitialising controllers
    resources needs a tidy up
    global middleware?
    passing configuration from widget to validator

validation
    have display detect validated_widget in rl
    selectionfield - auto item_validator
    client-side
    MatchField

    how to update
        updating A with B
        if B is AutoField
            update A with params B has specified
        else
            update B with params A has specified and B not *** this sounds like trouble!
            ok, for now just use B, any param set to auto is taken from A

move attrs generation to display? would make some other bits easier
